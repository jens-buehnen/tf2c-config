# Known Issues
These are things that I know don't work or don't work correctly with the HUD at the moment and can't do anything to fix right now, so don't bother me about them. If you do I will simply redirect you here.

### CTF HUD
Some elements of the CTF HUD are misaligned or misplaced in certain team configurations. [This happens with the default HUD](https://github.com/tf2classified/tf2classified-issue-tracker/issues/410) and it's not something I can fix.

### Team Menu
Models on the team menu disappear when Ubercharged. Again, [not something I can fix](https://github.com/tf2classified/tf2classified-issue-tracker/issues/492). This also happens in other similar menus with the default HUD but DarHud doesn't have any models on those.

The team menu in general is also sorta ugly, but this is due to limitations on what I can do with the team menu at the moment. Hopefully I can give it a proper face lift in the future.

# Addons
There are addons from the legacy version that are currently unimplemented.

### Scoreboard

The new scoreboard is a nightmare to do anything interesting or different with. Everything is pinned to the background, the game expects this background to be a certain size, and the game will just automatically pin things relative to the top left corner of the background even if you tell it to do otherwise. I can make BLU/RED 2-team, BLU/RED/GRN 3-team, and 4-team work, but everything else is mostly out of my control.

### Centered Meters

I don't feel like figuring out centered meters since they were such a headache last time *without* factoring in all the live TF2 meters. I gave it a try and I wasn't satisfied with the results.
If *you* can find somewhere to fit up to 3 vertically stacked meters in the middle of the bottom half of the screen without anything overlapping, be my guest. Best I could manage was one counter and one meter.

### Control Point Icons

The larger control point icons are probably possible but the arena control point unlock countdown label (and only the arena one for some reason) is an entirely separate element and it would likely end up misaligned. So possible, but not really convenient as it would likely require two files. I'm not against reimplementing it if people would be okay with needing two files.

### Console Command Windows

Console Command Windows can't really exist as it did before due to the removal of several GameUI windows that were cannibalised to make it work. There's other Training Mode dialogs I could use but they remain open when the game is unpaused and have to be manually closed, so not very convenient for console commands. It has been reimplemented as a customisation for the main menu, but there are fewer commands and it's less convenient to use since you can't freely move it around and you can't dismiss it. I'll probably continue to work on it over time but this is where it's at for now. Another personal request of mine would be to add in expandable panels from live TF2 so the window can be dismissed without needing to unpause the game or move files around, but again, I don't see that being a priority for them.
